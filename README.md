This webswites main page allows someone to see the different ratings between some of my favorite call of duty games.

The nav bar at the top allows a user to jump around easily on the page while remaining fixed on the top.

The nav bar also has links to the homepages for each of the games so a user can go learn more about them.

On the bottom of the page there is a five photo carousel that is on a loop through.
